2. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b fix-issue-123`
3. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards
4. **Write tests** if applicable
5. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message (see our [commit message guidelines](https://aboutcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/writing_good_commit_messages.html))

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Messages

We follow specific commit message conventions:

For detailed guidelines, see our [commit message documentation](https://aboutcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/writing_good_commit_messages.html).

Before submitting a pull request:
- Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks
