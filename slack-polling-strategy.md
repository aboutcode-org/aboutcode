# Slack Polling Strategy for AboutCode User Roles

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to gather user role information from the AboutCode Slack community to validate and refine our user roles framework.

We'd love to learn more about who you are and what brings you to AboutCode. Over the next few weeks, we'll be sharing some quick polls to gather this info.

Your participation will help us:
• Create better documentation for your specific needs
• Prioritize features that matter most to your use case
• Build resources that address your real-world challenges

## Implementation Guidelines

### Best Practices for Slack Polling:

1. **Timing**: Post polls during peak activity hours (typically 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM in major timezones)

2. **Engagement**: 
   - Pin important polls temporarily
   - Respond to comments to encourage participation
   - Share preliminary insights to maintain interest

3. **Follow-up**:
   - Thank participants publicly
   - Share aggregated results (without individual identification)
   - Explain how the feedback will be used

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Use clear, simple language
   - Provide context for each poll
   - Allow "Other" options with thread discussions

### Sample Engagement Messages:

**Encouraging Participation**:
```
🙏 Thanks to everyone who's participated so far! We're getting great insights.

If you haven't had a chance to weigh in yet, we'd still love to hear from you. Even if you're just lurking or new to the community, your perspective matters!

The polls will stay open through [date], and you can always add thoughts in the threads.
```

**Sharing Progress**:
```
📊 Quick update on our user research:

We're seeing interesting patterns emerge! Lots of diversity in roles and experience levels, which confirms we need resources for different audiences.

Still collecting responses - keep them coming! Results will help shape our 2024 documentation and feature priorities.
```
