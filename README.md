# AboutCode

### What is AboutCode?

AboutCode is a family of FOSS projects to uncover data ... about software:

-   where does the code come from? which software package?
-   what is its license? copyright?
-   is the code vulnerable, maintained, well coded?
-   what are its dependencies, are there vulnerabilities/licensing issues?

All these are questions that are important to answer: there are millions of free
and open source software components available on the web for reuse.

Knowing where a software package comes from, what its license is and whether it
is vulnerable should be a problem of the past such that everyone can safely
consume more free and open source software. We support not only open source
software, but also open data, generated and curated by our applications.

### Projects

Each AboutCode project has its own repository:

-   **[ScanCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit)**: a
    set of code scanning tools to detect the origin and license of code and
    dependencies. ScanCode now uses a plug-in architecture to run a series of
    scan-related tools in one process flow. This is the most popular project and
    is used by 100's of software teams . The lead maintainer is @pombredanne

-   **[Scancode.io](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io)**: is a
    web-based and API to run and review scans in rich scripted pipelines, on
    different kinds of containers, docker images, package archives, manifests
    etc, to get information on licenses, copyrights, source, vulnerabilities.
    The lead maintainer is @tdruez

-   **[VulnerableCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/vulnerablecode)**: is a
    web-based API and database to collect and track all the known software
    package vulnerabilities, with affected and fixed packages, references and a
    standalone tool Vulntotal to compare this vulnerability information across
    similar tools. This is maintained by @tg1999 and @pombredanne

-   **[univers](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/univers)** is a package to
    parse and compare all the package versions and all the ranges.

-   **[purlDB](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/purldb)** consists of tools to
    create and expose a database of purls (Package URLs) and also has package
    data for all of these packages created from scans. This is maintained by
    @jyang

-   **[FetchCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/fetchcode)** is a library to
    reliably fetch any code via HTTP, FTP and version control systems such as
    git.

-   **[Scancode Workbench](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-workbench)**:
    a desktop application based on typescript and react to visualize and review
    scan results from scancode scans.

-   **[AboutCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/aboutcode-toolkit)**:
    a set of command line tools to document the provenance of your code and
    generate attribution notices. AboutCode Toolkit uses small yaml files to
    document code provenance inside a codebase. The lead maintainer is
    @chinyeungli

-   **[container-inspector](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/container-inspector)**:
    a tool to analyze the structure and provenance of software components in
    Docker images using static analysis. Maintained by @pombredanne

-   **[python-inspector](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/python-inspector)**
    and **[nuget inspector](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/nuget-inspector/)**
    inspects manifests and code to resolve dependencies (vulnerable and
    non-vulnerable) for python and nuget packages respectively.

-   **[license-expression](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/license-expression/)**:
    a library to parse, analyze, compare and normalize SPDX and SPDX-like
    license expressions using a boolean logic expression engine. See
    https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version#h.jxpfx0ykyb60 to
    understand what an expression is. See
    https://github.com/aboutcode-org/license-expression for the code. The
    underlying boolean engine is live at https://github.com/bastikr/boolean.py .
    Both are co-maintained by @pombredanne

-   **ABCD aka AboutCode Data**: a simple set of conventions to define data
    structures that all the AboutCode tools can understand and use to exchange
    data. The details are at
    [AboutCode Data](https://aboutcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aboutcode-data/abcd.html).
    ABOUT files and ScanCode Toolkit data are examples of this approach. Other
    projects such as https://libraries.io and and
    [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/heremaps/oss-review-toolkit) are
    also using these conventions.

-   **[TraceCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/tracecode-toolkit)**:
    a set of tools to trace files from your deployment or distribution packages
    back to their origin in a development codebase or repository. The primary
    tool uses strace https://github.com/strace/strace/ to trace system calls on
    Linux and construct a build graph from syscalls to show which files are used
    to build a binary. We are contributors to strace. Maintained by @pombredanne

We also co-started and worked closely with other FOSS orgs and projects:

-   [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url): a widely used standard to
    reference software packages of all types with simple, readable and concise
    URLs.

-   [SPDX](http://SPDX.org): aka. Software Package Data Exchange, a spec to
    document the origin and licensing of packages.

-   [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) aka. OWASP CycloneDX is a full-stack Bill
    of Materials (BOM) standard that provides advanced supply chain capabilities
    for cyber risk reduction

-   [ClearlyDefined](https://ClearlyDefined.io): a project to review and help
    FOSS projects improve their licensing and documentation clarity. This
    project is incubating with https://opensource.org
