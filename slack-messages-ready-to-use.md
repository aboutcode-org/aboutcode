## Tips for Implementation

### Before You Start:
1. **Pin the introduction message** temporarily to increase visibility
2. **Set calendar reminders** for each message posting
3. **Prepare to engage** - respond to comments and questions promptly
4. **Consider time zones** - post during peak activity hours

### During the Process:
1. **Encourage participation** by responding to early contributors
2. **Ask follow-up questions** in threads to get more detail
3. **Thank participants** publicly to encourage others
4. **Share interesting insights** as they emerge

### Managing the Data:
1. **Screenshot poll results** before they expire
2. **Copy thread discussions** to a document for analysis
3. **Tag themes** as you see patterns emerging
4. **Keep participant information anonymous** in any summaries

This approach should give you rich, actionable data about your community while building engagement and showing that you value their input!
