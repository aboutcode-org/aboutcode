Privacy Policy
################

This page describes how the AboutCode community websites and documentation
handle personal data. It is intentionally simple and covers only what we
currently do. We will update it when practices change.

Scope
=====

- This policy applies to AboutCode-operated sites and documentation, including
  the content served from this repository and its published builds
  (for example, on Read the Docs).
- Individual AboutCode projects may run their own services (for example,
  demo deployments or APIs). Those services may have additional terms; check
  their documentation or service pages.

What we collect
===============

- Web server logs created by our hosting providers (for example, the IP
  address, requested URL, timestamp, user agent). These are used for routine
  operations, troubleshooting, and abuse prevention.
- Information you choose to share when you participate in our communities
  (for example, names and emails in commits, issues, or mailing lists, or
  profile information in chats). This data is public because you chose to
  publish it.
- Optional metrics collected by the platforms we use (for example, GitHub or
  Read the Docs may record usage for security and performance). That data is
  governed by the platform's own privacy terms.

What we do not do
=================

- We do not sell personal data.
- We do not run advertising or behavioral tracking on the documentation site.
- We do not use third-party analytics or cookies on the documentation site
  beyond what the hosting platforms require to operate.

How we use the data we have
===========================

- Operate and secure the sites and community services.
- Detect and mitigate abuse (for example, denial of service or spam).
- Improve documentation quality based on aggregated, non-identifying usage
  trends made available by the hosting platforms.

Retention
=========

- Hosting platforms control retention of their operational logs; these are
  typically short-lived and used for security and performance.
- Public contribution data (for example, issues, commits, and mailing list
  archives) remains publicly visible as part of the project history unless
  removed for legal or safety reasons.

Sharing
=======

- Hosting providers such as GitHub and Read the Docs process and may share data
  under their own terms and applicable law.
- We may disclose data if required to comply with legal obligations or to
  protect the security of the project and its community.

Your choices and requests
=========================

- You can avoid publishing personal data by limiting what you include in public
  contributions (for example, use a non-identifying email for commits).
- You can request removal of personal data that appears in our documentation or
  project materials when feasible and legally permissible.
- For analytics or cookies controlled by the hosting platforms, refer to their
  privacy settings and policies.
