Slack Polling Guide for User Roles
==========================

This guide explains how to conduct polls in Slack to gather user role information for the
AboutCode community.

Why Poll in Slack?
------------------

Slack polls are an effective way to:

- Engage active community members
- Gather information from users who are already participating
- Get quick feedback without requiring formal surveys
- Build community awareness of user diversity

Preparing Your Poll
-------------------

Before creating a poll, consider:

1. **Timing**: Post during active hours when most community members are online
2. **Frequency**: Don't poll too frequently to avoid survey fatigue
3. **Clarity**: Make questions clear and easy to answer
4. **Anonymity**: Decide if responses should be anonymous or attributed

Poll Options in Slack
---------------------

Slack offers several ways to conduct polls:

**1. Native Slack Polls (Recommended)**
    - Use Slack's built-in poll feature (if available in your workspace)
    - Type `/poll` followed by your question and options
    - Example: ``/poll "What's your primary role?" "Compliance Manager" "Security Engineer" "Developer" "Other"``

**2. Emoji Reactions**
    - Post a message with multiple options
    - Ask users to react with specific emojis for each option
    - Easy to set up and participate

**3. Thread-based Responses**
    - Post a question and ask users to reply in threads
    - Allows for more detailed responses
    - Good for open-ended questions

**4. Third-party Poll Apps**
    - Use Slack apps like Simple Poll, Polly, or SurveyMonkey
    - More features but requires app installation

Best Practices
--------------

**Do:**
- Keep polls short and focused
- Make participation easy (emoji reactions are quickest)
- Follow up with results and next steps
- Thank participants
- Use clear, simple language
- Post at times when your community is active

**Don't:**
- Ask too many questions at once
- Make polls mandatory
- Use jargon or technical terms unnecessarily
- Ignore responses or fail to follow up
- Poll too frequently

Following Up
-----------

After collecting responses:

1. **Thank Participants**: Acknowledge those who participated
2. **Share Results**: Summarize findings (anonymized if appropriate)
3. **Explain Next Steps**: Tell the community how you'll use the information
4. **Update Documentation**: Incorporate findings into the user roles framework
5. **Iterate**: Use feedback to refine future polls

Example Follow-up Message
-------------------------

.. code-block:: text

    📊 Thanks to everyone who participated in our user roles poll! 
    
    We received responses from:
    - 15 Compliance/Legal professionals
    - 12 Security Engineers
    - 20 Developers
    - 8 DevOps Engineers
    - 5 Students/Researchers
    - 3 Managers
    - 10 Contributors
    
    This helps us understand our community better. We'll be using this information 
    to:
    - Create role-specific documentation paths
    - Tailor our getting-started guides
    - Prioritize features that matter most to you
    
    Stay tuned for updates! 🎉

Alternative: Using Google Forms or Similar
------------------------------------------

If you need more detailed responses, consider:

1. **Google Forms**: Create a form and share the link in Slack
2. **Typeform**: More interactive but requires account
3. **SurveyMonkey**: Professional surveys with analysis tools

Then share the form link in #general with a brief explanation.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    📋 We're conducting a user roles survey to better understand our community!
    
    Please take 2-3 minutes to fill out this form:
    [link to form]
    
    Your responses help us improve documentation and prioritize features. 
    All responses are anonymous unless you choose to share your contact info.

Tips for Success
----------------

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a simple emoji reaction poll
2. **Be Patient**: Not everyone will respond immediately
3. **Remind Gently**: A follow-up reminder after 24-48 hours is okay
4. **Make it Fun**: Use emojis and friendly language
5. **Show Value**: Explain why their input matters

Remember: The goal is to understand your community, not to collect data for its own sake.
Use the information to improve the AboutCode experience for everyone!
