========================================
For Legal & Compliance Professionals
========================================

Welcome! If you're responsible for ensuring your organization's software complies with
licensing requirements, manages open source risks, or needs to generate attribution
documentation, you're in the right place.

AboutCode provides tools to help you understand what's in your software, ensure license
compliance, and generate the reports you need for audits and legal reviews.

What You Can Accomplish
=======================

With AboutCode, you can:

- **Understand License Obligations**: Identify all licenses in your codebase and
  understand what they require
- **Manage License Policies**: Define which licenses are approved, restricted, or
  prohibited for your organization
- **Generate Attribution Documents**: Automatically create license notices and attribution files
- **Review Supplier SBOMs**: Analyze software bills of materials from your vendors
- **Support Regulatory Compliance**: Meet requirements like the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

Key Workflows
=============

1. Managing License Policies
----------------------------

Define your organization's license policies and apply them consistently across all projects.

You can specify which licenses are approved for use, which require legal review, and which
are prohibited. These policies can then be applied automatically when scanning code.

**Learn more:** :ref:`manage-license-policies`

**Tools you'll use:** DejaCode, ScanCode.io

2. Generating Attribution Documents
-----------------------------------

When you ship software that includes open source components, you need to provide proper
attribution to comply with license terms.

AboutCode can automatically generate attribution notices, license texts, and other
required documentation based on your scan results.

**Learn more:** :ref:`create-sboms`

**Tools you'll use:** ScanCode Toolkit, DejaCode, AboutCode Toolkit

3. Reviewing Software from Suppliers
------------------------------------

When you receive software from vendors or suppliers, you need to understand what's
included and whether it meets your compliance requirements.

You can import SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials) from suppliers, enrich the data with
additional analysis, and verify compliance with your policies.

**Learn more:** :ref:`consume-sboms`

**Tools you'll use:** ScanCode.io, DejaCode, PurlDB

4. Supporting CRA Compliance
----------------------------

The EU Cyber Resilience Act requires manufacturers to provide transparency about the
software components in their products.

AboutCode provides the scanning, analysis, and SBOM generation capabilities you need to
meet these requirements.

**Tools you'll use:** DejaCode, ScanCode.io
