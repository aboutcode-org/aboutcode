**Scancode-Workbench Documentation**
====================================

ScanCode Workbench allows you take the scan results from the ScanCode Toolkit and create a software inventory annotated with your summaries or conclusions (we call these Conclusions) at any levels of the codebase you choose.

The attributes you add (e.g., Name, Version, Owner, License Expression, Copyright) to your Conclusion about a single package or file -- or a higher-level group of packages and/or files -- can then be exported to a JSON or SQLite file. In addition, Conclusions created in ScanCode Workbench can be exported to DejaCode.
