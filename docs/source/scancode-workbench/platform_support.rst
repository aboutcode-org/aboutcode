ScanCode Workbench Platform Support
===================================

Our approach for platform support is to focus on one primary release for each of Linux, MacOS and Windows. The Priority definitions are:

#. Primary - These are the primary platforms for build/test/release on an ongoing basis.
#. Secondary - These are platforms where the primary ScanCode Workbench release for the corresponding OS Group should be forward-compatible, e.g., Windows 7 build should work on Windows 10. Issues reported and traced to a Secondary platform may not be fixed.
#. Tertiary - These are any other platforms not listed as Primary or Secondary. In these cases, we will help users help themselves, but we are likely not to fix Issues that only surface on a Tertiary platform.

Electron Supported Platforms
----------------------------
https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms/

The following platforms are supported by Electron:

MacOS
^^^^^

Only 64-bit binaries are provided for MacOS, and the minimum MacOS version supported is MacOS 10.9.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Windows 7 and later are supported, while older operating systems are not supported (and do not work). Both ia32 (x86) and x64 (amd64) binaries are provided for Windows. Please note: the ARM version of Windows is not supported for now.

Linux
^^^^^

The prebuilt ia32 (i686) and x64 (amd64) binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 12.04, and the ARM binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and NEON for Debian Wheezy.

Whether the prebuilt binary can run on a distribution depends on whether the distribution includes the libraries that Electron is linked to on the building platform, so only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work, but the following platforms are also verified to be able to run the prebuilt binaries of Electron:

- Ubuntu 12.04 and later
- Fedora 21
- Debian 8
