==================================================
:index:`GSoD : Technical Writer Selection Process`
==================================================

Thank you for your interest in creating technical documentation for `scancode.io <https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io>`_.


OUR EXPECTATIONS
----------------

Technical Writing Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should have been actively writing technical documentation, and have multiple publicly
available samples of your work.

Familiarity with scancode.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to learn how scancode.io works, its functions and features in order to write
effective and useful technical documentation. We currently have some basic documentation at
`scancodeio.readthedocs.io <https://scancodeio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

You will also need to know or learn the key concepts of Software Composition Analysis in order
to understand your audience. You will have access to a nexB instance of scancode.io, but you will
also need to be able to install and run scancode.io locally on your own computer.

Familiarity with Sphinx, RTD, git/GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should have experience writing documentation in a Sphinx/reStructuredText environment where
the documentation is managed side by side with the code in a GitHub project repository. We treat
technical documentation like code, tested for successful builds and checked with linters for
quality control.

Eagerness to learn about and document scancode.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We expect you to try scancode.io out yourself and familiarize yourself with it, and to be eager
to learn and document all aspects of it, particularly the How-To Guides and Tutorials.

Here are some suggestions for you to consider as documentation topics:

- Did you encounter any difficulties installing scancode.io locally?  Assuming that you resolved
  them, can you improve the documentation to help others?
- Do you understand how the pipelines work?  How would you explain pipelines to others in greater
  detail?
- Do you understand how to interpret and get full value from scan results?  How would you document
  ways to get the most out of the scan results?

We use `Diataxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ - as a design framework for our documentation.

.. note::

    Reach out to us if you have any specific questions on setting up and using scancode.io locally
    or in general. `Link to Gitter Chat <https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs/>`_
