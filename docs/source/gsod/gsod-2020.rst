===================================
:index:`Google Season of Docs 2020`
===================================

AboutCode.org is applying to be a mentoring organization for the `Google Season of Docs (GSoD) 2020 <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>`_.

In the event that our application is accepted, we'll be looking for fellow members of the FOSS
community with technical writing skills and an interest in helping.  If you're interested, keep
reading to get a sense of what we have in mind for GSoD 2020.

AboutCode is a family of FOSS projects for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and FOSS Compliance:

* Where does code come from?
* What is its license?
* What is its origin and copyright?
* Is the code secure, maintained, well coded?

All of these questions are important, and are relevant to millions of free and open source software
components available on the web for reuse. The answers are critical to ensure that anyone and
everyone can safely consume free and open source software.

*Join us to make it so!*

Our tools are used to detect and report the origin and license of source code, packages and
binaries as well as to discover software and package dependencies. We are also working on projects
to track security vulnerabilities, bugs and other important software package attributes.

List of AboutCode projects
--------------------------

Our focus for GSoD 2020 is on `ScanCode Toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_
and `Scancode Workbench <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_,
but proposals to improve the documentation for other AboutCode projects are welcome.

See :ref:`aboutcode-project-overview` for a complete list of AboutCode projects.

Contact Info
------------

Join the chat online or by IRC at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs.
Introduce yourself and start the discussion!

You can also contact:

- the primary org admin directly: @pombredanne and pombredanne@gmail.com
- the GSoD coordinator directly: jmhoran@nexb.com

Technology
----------

We primarily use Python for AboutCode software. There is also some code in C/C++ or other
languages. We use Electron/JavaScript for the ScanCode Workbench desktop application.

Our domain includes text analysis and processing (e.g., for copyright and license
detection), parsing (for package manifest formats), binary analysis (to detect the origin and
license of binaries), web-based tools and APIs (to expose the tools and libraries as web
services) and low-level data structures for efficient matching (such as Aho-Corasick and
other automata).

For documentation we primarily use reStructured Text files with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs.
For command line tools we use text files for help documentation.
There is still some project documentation in project wikis, but our goal is to migrate
that to ReadTheDocs.
For each project there will also be a README and a few other files in the corresponding
GitHub repository.

Technical Writing Skills Needed
-------------------------------

Incoming technical writers will need the following skills:

- Ability to install and configure open source code from GitHub.
- Ability to understand and run programs from the command line in a terminal window.
- An interest in FOSS licensing and software code and origin analysis.

During the application process and during a GSoD project with us you will learn how to:

- Design and create documentation as Tutorials, HowTo Guides, Reference or Discussions.

  - See https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/ for more information about this approach.

- Create and edit documentation files in reStructured Text.
- Manage documentation files with Sphinx.
- Publish documentation to ReadTheDocs.

We are happy to help you get up to speed. The more you are able to demonstrate ability and
skills in advance, the more likely we are to choose your application!

About Your Project Application
------------------------------

Your application should be in the range of 1,000 words, and should contain the following
information, plus anything else that you think is relevant:

- Your name and contact details.

- Title of your proposal.

- Abstract of your proposal.

- Description of your idea including an explanation of what it will contribute to the project.

- Description of previous work, existing solutions, open-source projects, preferably with links.

- Details of your academic studies and any previous internships.

- Description of your relevant skills.

- Do you plan to have any other commitments during GSoD that may affect your work? Any
  vacations/holidays? Will you be available full time to work on your project? Please apply
  only if this is a serious full time commitment during the GSoD time frame.

Join the chat online or by IRC at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs.
Introduce yourself and start a discussion!

An excellent, competitive way to demonstrate your capability would be to submit a documentation
improvement to an AboutCode project, especially to ScanCode Toolkit or ScanCode Workbench.

You can pick a project idea from the list below. You can also submit
`Your Documentation Project Ideas <#your-documentation-project-ideas-2020>`_.

Our Documentation Project Ideas
-------------------------------

Note that the AboutCode focus for GSoD 2020 is on ScanCode Toolkit and ScanCode Workbench,
although proposals to improve the documentation for other AboutCode projects are welcome.

`Your Documentation Project Ideas <#your-documentation-project-ideas-2020>`_ are welcome too! Please
chat about them to increase your chances of success!

Your Documentation Project Ideas
--------------------------------

Download and install `ScanCode Toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_
and `Scancode Workbench <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_ and try them out.
For example, you
may try scanning an open source software package in a technology with which you are familiar.
What are the documentation weak points?


* Is it difficult to get started? A **Tutorial** documentation opportunity.
* Is it difficult to accomplish a specific objective? A **How-To** documentation opportunity.
* Are the capabilities of the tool too mysterious? Do you want to know more about what you can do
  with it? A **Reference** documentation opportunity.
* Do you feel that you need to understand its concepts better in order to use it and trust it? Do
  you want to know more about how the code scanning actually works? A **Discussion** documentation
  opportunity.

Feel free to propose and describe your own documentation ideas.

Mentoring
---------

We welcome new mentors to help with the program. We require some understanding of the project
domain to join as a mentor. Contact the team on Gitter at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs
