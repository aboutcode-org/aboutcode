   TESTING
 ###############
   
*   You've written and tested your code, but before sending code out for review, run all the tests for the whole tree to make sure the changes don't break other           
    packages or programs.

*    After running for a while and printing a lot of testing output, the command should finish by printing,

     ALL TESTS PASSED


*    In the  (https://github.com/nexB/, For Example) repositories
     Run the tests for the entire repository.

*    If you're concerned about the build status, you can check the Build Dashboard. Test failures may also be caught  in code review.

*    Some repositories will have different testing infrastructures, so always check the documentation for the repository in which you are working The README file in the
     root of the repository will usually have this information.
