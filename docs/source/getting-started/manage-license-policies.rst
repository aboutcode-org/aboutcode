Use AboutCode to manage and communicate license policies
========================================================

You can define the Usage Policy choices that may apply to various application object
types such as Licenses, Components, Subcomponent relationships, and Packages.
For each application object type, you can specify the Usage Policy label text, icon,
and icon color for each relevant policy position that you need to communicate to your
users. Examples include Recommended, Approved, Restricted, and Prohibited.
