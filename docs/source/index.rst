AboutCode
#########

Welcome to the AboutCode documentation homepage. `AboutCode.org
<https://www.aboutcode.org/>`_ is a community of open source developers who
are trying to make open source easier to use by providing open source tools
to discover, identify and track open source components (aka Software
Composition Analysis – SCA). AboutCode is the collective name for these
open source tools.

This home page provides a directory of our major projects and their
documentation on ReadTheDocs plus information about how to contribute to
AboutCode documentation.

All community contributions are welcome.
