AboutCode
=========

AboutCode is a family of free and open-source tools that help organizations
understand what software they use, where it comes from, how it is licensed, and
whether it is safe. These tools analyze source code, packages, containers, and
build artifacts to answer essential software supply-chain questions.

This documentation provides an overview of the AboutCode ecosystem, with links
to individual projects and their documentation.
