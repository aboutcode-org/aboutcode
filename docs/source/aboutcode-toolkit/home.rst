AboutCode Toolkit
=================

Introduction
------------
The AboutCode Toolkit and ABOUT files provide a simple way to document the
origin, license, usage and other important or interesting information about
third-party software components that you use in your project.

You start by storing ABOUT files (a small YAML formatted text file with field/value pairs)
side-by-side with each of the third-party software components you use.
Each ABOUT file documents origin and license for one software.
There are many examples of ABOUT files (valid or invalid) in the testdata/
directory of the whole repository.

The current version of the AboutCode Toolkit can read these ABOUT files so that you
can collect and validate the inventory of third-party components that you use.

In addition, this tool is able to generate attribution notices and
identify redistributable source code used in your project to help you comply
with open source licenses conditions.

This version of the AboutCode Toolkit follows the ABOUT specification version 3.2.1 at:
https://aboutcode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html
