ScanCode Toolkit
================

ScanCode Toolkit
is a code scanning "engine" and command-line tool to detect the
provenance and license of code and its dependencies. ScanCode TK is a
command-line tool with many scanning options and output formats (JSON,
HTML, CSV or SPDX). ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, package
manifests and more in both source code and binary files. There is already
a large set of pre- and post-plugins and you can also create your own
plugins.
