ScanCode LicenseDB
==================

`ScanCode LicenseDB <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-licensedb>`_:
is a large free and open database of software licenses, in particular open-source
software licenses, with over 2300 curated licenses texts and their metadata.

LicenseDB is built from the ScanCode Toolkit license dataset. ScanCode Toolkit
is a leading open source code scanner and license detection engine.

LicenseDB is an essential reference license resource for license compliance and
SBOMs. LicenseDB includes all the SPDX and OSI licenses together with an extended
curated collection of other licenses and license metadata. These licenses are
carefully reviewed and curated and continuously updated by an open community of
contributors.

LicenseDB is available as a web site at: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/
You can search the licenses by name, key and other attributes. The web site is updated
daily by a GitHub action with updates from scancode-toolkit develop.

LicenseDB is also available as a JSON or YAML API and a git repository
making it easy to reuse and integrate in tools that need a database of reference
software licenses.
