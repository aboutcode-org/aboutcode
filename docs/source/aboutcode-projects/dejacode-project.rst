DejaCode
========

`DejaCode <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/dejacode>`_: is a Cloud
application server that automates open source license compliance and ensures
software supply chain integrity. It is a comprehensive enterprise-level application,
powered by `ScanCode <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_,
the industry-leading code scanner.

  - Run scans and track all the open source and third-party products and components used
   in your software.
  - Apply usage policies at the license or component level, and integrate into
   ScanCode to ensure compliance.
  - Capture software inventories (SBOMs), generate compliance artifacts, and keep
   historical data.
  - Ensure FOSS compliance with enterprise-grade features and integrations for DevOps and
   software systems.
  - Scan a software package, simply by providing its Download URL, to get comprehensive
   details of its composition and create an SBOM.
  - Load software package data into DejaCode with the integration for the open source
   ScanCode.io and ScanCode Toolkit projects to create a productâ€™s SBOM.
  - Track and report vulnerability tracking and reporting by integrating with the open
   source VulnerableCode project.
  - Create, publish and share SBOM documents in DejaCode, including detailed attribution
   documentation and custom reports in multiple file formats and standards, such as
   CycloneDX and SPDX.
