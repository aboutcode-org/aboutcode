Comprehensive Installation
==========================

ScanCode requires Python 2.7.x and is tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Make sure Python 2.7 is installed first.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Hardware : ScanCode will run best with a modern X86 processor and at least 2GB of RAM and 250MB of disk.

- Supported operating systems : ScanCode should run on these OSes:

	#. Linux: on most recent 64-bit Linux distributions (32-bit distros are only partially supported),
	#. Mac: on recent Mac OSX (10.6.8 and up),
	#. Windows: on Windows 7 and up (32- or 64-bit) using a 32-bit Python.

Prerequisites
-------------
ScanCode needs a Python 2.7 interpreter.

- On Linux: Use your package manager to install python2.7. If Python 2.7 is not available from your package manager, you must compile it from sources. For instance, visit https://github.com/dejacode/about-code-tool/wiki/BuildingPython27OnCentos6 for instructions to compile Python from sources on Centos.

- On Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04, you will need to install these packages first: ``python-dev bzip2 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``

- On Debian and Debian-based distros you will need to install these packages first: ``python-dev libbz2-1.0 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``

- On RPM-based distros, you will need to install these packages first: ``python-devel zlib bzip2-libs xz-libs libxml2-devel libxslt-devel``

- **On Windows**:

	Use the Python 2.7 32-bit (e.g. the Windows x86 MSI installer) for X86 regardless of whether you run Windows on 32-bit or 64-bit. DO NOT USE Python X86_64 installer even if you run 64 bit Windows. Download Python from this url: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi

	Install Python on the c: drive and use all default installer options(scancode will try to find python just in c:\python27\python.exe). See the Windows installation section for more installation details.

- On Mac: Download and install Python from this url: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13-macosx10.6.pkg

Do not use Unicode, non-ASCII in your installation Path

There is a bug in underlying libraries that prevent this.

Installation on Linux and Mac
-----------------------------

Download and extract the latest ScanCode release from:
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/latest

Open a terminal in the extracted directory and run::

	./scancode --help       

This will configure ScanCode and display the command line help.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

- Download the latest ScanCode release zip file from https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/latest

- In Windows Explorer (called File Explorer on Windows 10), select the downloaded ScanCode zip and right-click.

- In the pop-up menu select 'Extract All...'

- In the pop-up window 'Extract zip folders' ('Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders' on Windows 10) use the default options to extract.

- Once the extraction is complete, a new Windows Explorer/File Explorer window will pop up.

- In this Explorer window, select the new folder that was created and right-click.

	* On Windows 10, double-click the new folder, select one of the files inside the folder (e.g., 'setup.py'), and right-click.
- In the pop-up menu select 'Properties'.

- In the pop-up window 'Properties', select the Location value. Copy this to the clipboard and close the 'Properties' window.

- Press the start menu button. (On Windows 10, click the search box or search icon in the taskbar.)

- In the search box type::

	cmd

- Select 'cmd.exe' listed in the search results. (On Windows 10, you may see 'Command Prompt' instead -- select that.)

- A new 'cmd.exe' window ('Command Prompt' on Windows 10) pops up.

- In this window (aka a 'command prompt'), type the following (i.e., 'cd' followed by a space)::

	cd

- Right-click in this window and select Paste. This will paste the path where you extracted ScanCode.

- Press Enter.

- This will change the current location of your command prompt to the root directory where scancode is installed.

- Then type::

	scancode -h                                                                       

- Press enter. This will configure your ScanCode installation.

- Several messages are displayed followed by the scancode command help.

- The installation is complete.

Un-installation
---------------

- Delete the directory in which you extracted ScanCode.
- Delete any temporary files created in your system temp directory under a scancode directory.
