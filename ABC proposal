# ABC Proposal Process

## 1. Introduction
To ensure consistency across our organization, we need a structured way to document and adopt standards, best practices, and policies. This process is inspired by Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and follows a clear lifecycle for discussion, approval, and adoption.

## 2. Proposal Document Structure
Each proposal (ABC-XXXX) should follow a well-defined structure:

### **Title:**
A concise and descriptive title for the proposal.

### **Abstract:**
A brief summary of what the proposal covers and its intended purpose.

### **Motivation:**
Explain why this proposal is needed. Highlight the problem it aims to solve and the benefits of adoption.

### **Specification:**
Detailed description of the proposal, including any technical specifications, guidelines, or standards.

### **Implementation Plan:**
Outline the steps required to roll out this proposal. Include potential timelines, dependencies, and responsibilities.

### **Impact & Considerations:**
Discuss potential challenges, risks, and necessary adjustments. Consider backward compatibility and adoption hurdles.

### **Author(s):**
Name(s) of the person(s) who drafted the proposal.

## 3. Process for Adoption
1. **Draft Submission:**
   - New proposals are created as markdown files in the `/proposals` directory.
   - The document should follow the ABC-XXXX format.
   
2. **Review & Discussion:**
   - The proposal is submitted as a PR to the repository.
   - Team members review, discuss, and suggest modifications.
   
3. **Approval & Merging:**
   - Once consensus is reached, the proposal is approved and merged.
   - The proposal status is updated to **Accepted**.
   
4. **Implementation & Monitoring:**
   - Teams adopt the approved proposal in workflows and projects.
   - Regular reviews ensure the proposal remains relevant.

5. **Deprecation & Updates:**
   - If a proposal becomes obsolete or is replaced, its status is updated accordingly (e.g., **Superseded**, **Deprecated**).

## 4. Numbering & Naming Convention
- Each proposal follows the format `ABC-XXXX`, where `XXXX` is a sequential number.
- Consider adding category prefixes, e.g., `ABC-STANDARD-0001` for coding standards, `ABC-GUIDELINE-0002` for best practices.

## 5. Review & Maintenance
- Periodic reviews ensure proposals remain relevant.
- Updates can be proposed through amendments (e.g., `ABC-XXXX-A1`).
- Team members are encouraged to contribute refinements over time.

This structured process will help maintain consistency and clarity in organizational standards while ensuring they evolve through collaboration.
